# GameObject Inventory System 
## Description 
This is a gameobject based inventory system I am developing for my upcoming indie game "Chrono-Vice". It works by simply utilizing Unity's 2D box collider on Trigger Enter/Exit system, and having inventory objects collide with invisible 2D box colliders and sending those inventory objects into a seperate inventory screen, these objects are then randomly placed.
